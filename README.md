# Sentiment Analysis using RNN
 This repository consists of my implementation of sentiment analysis using RNN machine learning model.
 NOTE:
 Install the requirements from the requirements.txt file
 command:
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 
 This repository doesnt contains the ft_model_bin.npy as it was over 100 MB file.
 This model has the implementation of training on custom word embedding - word2vec.
 
 EXECUTING THE WEBAPP:
 Download the code
 Open terminal and run the following command:
 ```bash
 python app.py
 ```
 
 This will open the web app and there you can insert your texts to get sentiments (negative,positive) and score.
 
 ALTERNATIVELY :
 You can just run the .ipynb file named RNN(w2v) to train the model and run the score analysis.
